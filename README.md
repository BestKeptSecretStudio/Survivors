# Survivors

A base/survivor management game set in a zombie-riddled world.

## Intentions

A middle-ground between _State of Decay 2_ and _Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead_. Simple yet deep gameplay loop.

Text-based, with minimal graphics that serve to augment the text and the UX.

Test bed for my in-depth TTRPG system. It is likely to shine its brightest in an environment where all the variables are computed outside of the player's brain.

## Status

_March 03, 2024_

Initial sketches. Visual design, gameplay loop implementation, code architecture.

### Current goals

[ ] establish a baseline gameplay loop: recon → loot / combat → rest / craft / build / research → recon...
[ ] shallow implementation of RPG elements
[ ] initial, minimal-yet-effective UI
[ ] basic items
